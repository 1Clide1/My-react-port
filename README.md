## Description

This app is as the title says a cool portfolio that I made with react. If someone wants to see what I can do this is the perfect website to show them my skills and what I can do with web development. You get an idea of who I am and what I do, get an idea of my projects and what I have made so far and also have a way to contact me personally if they want to get in touch with me.

## Usage

You can use this app to get an idea of what I do and what I am about, my projects, view my github or other social media links and also contact me if you want to ask me a question.

## Credits

This project was honestly hard and time consuming to make I feel like I used a lot of resources to find what I needed and I used all of my css knowledge to fully create this. The biggest challenge was trying to get the github pages npm to work but luckily I did find the answer and was able to push my project out to the github pages. Other than that it was also hard to really make this website responsive and useable for multiple screen sizes I feel like I still need to tweak the about section on certain screen sizes however for what I have right now I think it will be okay. I still want to keep improving this app so I don't think I will ever be fully finished with this portfolio app but where I am at I think I did a pretty good job.
