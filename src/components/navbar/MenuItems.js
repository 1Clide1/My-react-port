// this is where I will keep the navbar items that way it is easier to see/structer
// this is made into an array and then will be targeting this array to generate all of the navbar items
// const has to be the same name as the imports, makes more sense when you say it out loud lol
// make sure to export this
export const MenuItems = [
  {
    name: "Home",
    // url is just short for href
    url: "#Home",
    // cName is just short for class name
    cName: "navbar-links",
  },
  {
    name: "My Work",
    url: "#Projects",
    cName: "navbar-links",
  },
  {
    name: "Contact Me",
    url: "#Contact Me",
    cName: "navbar-links",
  },
];
